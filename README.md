This Python package was used to investigate the performance of the standard Echo State Network(ESN) model for image segmentation based on the features created by
Structural Tensor. Some of the study's results appeared in the proceedings of [MESAS 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14984-0_36).
